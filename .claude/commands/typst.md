Convert the above response to Typst markup (https://typst.app/docs/reference/).

Be minimalistic: prefer plain text over formatting. Use bold, italics, headers, and bullet points sparingly—only where they genuinely aid comprehension. Limit header depth to two levels. Aim for the understated style of a technical book, not a slide deck.

Be concise: tighten prose, cut redundancy.
