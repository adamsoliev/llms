Read this doc as a skeptical engineer who needs to implement or depend on this system.

**Part 1: Extract the structure**
- Identify the main ideas (not sections, the actual claims/decisions/designs)
- Under each, list the supporting points, constraints, or rationale given
- Omit filler; if a section doesn't advance understanding, note that it's thin

**Part 2: Critique**
Flag:
- Ambiguities that would block implementation or cause divergent interpretations
- Unstated assumptions or missing context
- Inconsistencies between sections
- Failure modes or edge cases that aren't addressed
- Anything that smells like hand-waving over hard problems

Keep the summary and critique separate. Don't summarize what the doc says in prose—give me the skeleton.
