I think this is ready for final polish—you be the judge.

Review and flag issues at each level:

**Argument:** Central claim clear? Supporting points hold up? Counter-arguments steelmanned, not strawmanned? Easy rebuttals I'm missing?

**Structure:** Logical order? Anything redundant, misplaced, or burying the lede?

**Sentence-level:** Awkward phrasing, vague words, repetition, weak hedging, abrupt transitions, anything that doesn't earn its place.

**Voice target:** Senior engineer sharing notes with peers. Direct imperatives, dense tables over prose, unhedged recommendations, assumes fluency, signal over narrative. Flag drift.

If the argument needs work, say so before nitpicking commas.

Preserve my voice. Make edits inline with brief marginal notes where useful.
